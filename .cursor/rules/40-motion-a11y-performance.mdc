# Animation, A11y & Performance Guardrails

## Animation
- Use **Framer Motion** with transform/opacity only. Typical durations: **200â€“800ms**.
- Avoid animating layout properties (top/left/width/height) unless trivial.
- Provide keyboard/hover/focus affordances equivalently.

**Example**
```tsx
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 12 }}
  whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.3 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.4, ease: 'easeOut' }}
/>
```

## Accessibility
- Ensure visible focus styles on interactive elements.
- Provide `aria-label` for icon-only buttons and role-appropriate markup.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`: disable parallax/particles; provide static artwork.

## Performance
- Dynamic import heavy UI (modals, charts, carousels). Avoid SSR for purely decorative components.
- Optimize images: correct `sizes`, lazy by default, eager only for hero.
- Keep CLS minimal; reserve space for async content.
- Run Lighthouse (Perf/A11y/Best Practices/SEO) for touched pages and fix regressions.
