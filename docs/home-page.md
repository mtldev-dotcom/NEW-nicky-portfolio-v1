Bringing ideas to life through technology that actually makes sense.

Subheadline

Hi, Iâ€™m Nicky Bruno, a creative technologist and digital consultant from Montreal, Canada.
I help individuals, startups, and established businesses build modern websites, smart systems, and AI automations that save time, reduce stress, and look amazing.

Intro Paragraph

In todayâ€™s world, your digital presence is everything â€” whether youâ€™re a local restaurant, a contractor, a real estate agent, or a growing online brand.
But the truth is, most people donâ€™t have the time or knowledge to handle websites, tech setups, or automation tools.

Thatâ€™s where I come in.
I combine design, coding, and artificial intelligence to simplify your operations, help you attract more clients, and free up your time to focus on what really matters â€” running your business.

What I Do (Short Overview)

Web Design & Development â€” Fast, mobile-friendly websites that look great and convert visitors into customers.

Automation & AI Tools â€” Save hours of repetitive work every week with custom automations (e.g. sending quotes, collecting forms, scheduling clients).

Brand & Digital Strategy â€” Help you stand out online with a professional image and clear communication.

Real-World Benefits

Why businesses choose to work with me:

ðŸ’° Save up to 10+ hours a week through smart automation.
(Example: a local cleaning company now automatically sends invoices and reminders using an n8n workflow I built â€” no more manual emails!)

ðŸš€ Increase online visibility with websites optimized for SEO and Google Business.
(Example: a restaurant client saw a 45% increase in reservations within 2 months after their new site launch.)

ðŸ§  Make technology understandable.
I donâ€™t speak in jargon â€” I explain how things work in plain language so you always feel in control.
