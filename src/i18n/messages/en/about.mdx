# Hi, I’m Nicky — developer, designer, and creative problem solver based in Montreal

I connect the dots between **technology**, **creativity**, and **efficiency**. Over two decades, I’ve helped business owners, entrepreneurs, and teams bring ideas to life through **websites**, **automation**, **design systems**, and **digital strategy** — always focused on practical results.

---

## What I Do

- Build beautiful, easy-to-use **websites** that attract and convert customers  
- Set up **automations** that handle repetitive tasks so you can focus on growth  
- Create clear, modern **branding and design systems** that stand out  
- Develop **digital products** — from dashboards to e‑commerce stores  
- Offer **training and guidance** so you and your team stay confident using new tools  

---

## Everyday Examples

- **Website Example**  
  You own a renovation company and want clients to request quotes online. I’ll design a site that looks professional, loads fast, and automatically sends inquiries to your email or CRM — no copy‑pasting needed.

- **Automation Example (Non‑AI)**  
  You get customer messages from your website, Facebook, and email. Instead of checking all three, I can connect them into one dashboard so you never miss a message again.

- **AI Automation Example**  
  You receive dozens of customer questions daily — most are similar. I can set up a smart virtual assistant that answers FAQs instantly and sends you only the complex requests.

- **Design & Branding Example**  
  You’re launching a new product and want your brand to feel unified — from logo to packaging to social posts. I’ll design a consistent look that communicates your values and quality.

- **Learning Example**  
  You’ve invested in digital tools but don’t know how to use them efficiently. I’ll show you step by step how to make the most of them — without jargon or confusion.

---

## My Approach

- Technology should **simplify** your day, not complicate it.  
- Good design builds **trust** before a single word is spoken.  
- Every project should create **real results** — not just pretty visuals.  

That’s why I combine design, code, and strategy to build solutions that are practical, modern, and built for growth.

## Behind the Screen

When I’m not building digital systems, I’m sketching UI ideas, experimenting with lighting tech for Lumicerra, or playing outside with my daughter Eva.
