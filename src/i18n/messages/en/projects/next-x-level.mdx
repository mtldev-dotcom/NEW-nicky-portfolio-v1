## Context

Next X Level needed a growth engine that could support rapid campaign launches in English and French while staying on brand. Their previous stack tied design and content changes to code releases.

## Approach

- **Component system.** Audited legacy layouts and rebuilt them as composable, locale-aware blocks with design tokens mapped to Tailwind.
- **Content operations.** Integrated Contentful with visual preview environments and automated content validations.
- **Experiment framework.** Added event tracking focused on path-to-conversion, with rich context for A/B testing.

## Outcome

Marketing can now publish a new campaign in hours instead of weeks. Engineers extend the design system once, and translators work inside familiar tools with live previews. The site scores 98 on Lighthouse performance and powers continual experimentation.
