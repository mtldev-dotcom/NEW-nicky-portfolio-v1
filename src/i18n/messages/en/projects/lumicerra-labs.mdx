## Context

Lumicerra produces modular lighting systems monitored through LiDAR and sensor arrays. Data lived across spreadsheets and a legacy dashboard that couldnâ€™t support French or English localization. Teams lacked a shared view for commissioning, maintenance, and analytics.

## Approach

1. **Information architecture.** Consolidated control center workflows into navigation designed around site, fixture, and alert hierarchies.
2. **Visual language.** Introduced a dark UI with Electric Green accents for status cues, paired with bilingual typography guidance.
3. **Telemetry pipeline.** Partnered with engineering to standardize event schemas and stream real-time updates via WebSockets.
4. **Predictive insights.** Built anomaly detection dashboards so operations sees trends before outages happen.

## Outcome

Architects, integrators, and operations now collaborate within a single interface. Localization unlocks adoption across Canadian and European teams, while predictive alerts reduced emergency dispatches by more than half.
