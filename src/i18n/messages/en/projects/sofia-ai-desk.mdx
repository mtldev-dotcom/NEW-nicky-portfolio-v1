## Context

Sofiaâ€™s support team handles thousands of tickets a month in English and French. Manual triage led to long response times, duplicated work, and fragmented knowledge. The team needed an automation layer without losing the human touch.

## Approach

1. **Mapped critical workflows.** Interviewed agents in both languages to capture intents, edge cases, and escalation triggers.
2. **Centralized knowledge.** Built a vector index pulling from Confluence, Zendesk macros, and Notion playbooks.
3. **Designed a bilingual agent desk.** Crafted an interface that surfaces AI summaries, recommended replies, and automation suggestions.
4. **Implemented retraining loops.** Every resolved ticket feeds evaluation metrics to improve prompt templates weekly.

## Outcome

The AI desk now triages 68% of inbound tickets automatically and suggests responses in the right language. Human agents stay in control while focusing on the tickets that require empathy or nuanced problem-solving. Leadership receives weekly reports on automation coverage and satisfaction scores.
